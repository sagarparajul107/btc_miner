## Overview

This project is a simple shell script to demonstrate the principles of Bitcoin mining using a CPU. It includes:
- Wallet configuration.
- Mining pool integration.
- Simulated hash rate generation.
- Earnings tracking and withdrawal simulation.

This script is **for educational purposes only**. It does not perform actual Bitcoin mining and should not be misused.

## Features

1. **Dynamic Wallet Entry:**  
   Users can input their Bitcoin wallet address at runtime.

2. **Mining Pool Support:**  
   Integrated with the `f2pool` mining pool for demonstration purposes.

3. **Earnings Simulation:**  
   Tracks shares and displays estimated earnings in real-time.

4. **Withdrawal Simulation:**  
   Automatically triggers a simulated withdrawal when earnings reach $50.

5. **Resource Efficiency:**  
   Optimized CPU usage to protect system performance.

   cd btc_miner


* Wallet address configuration.
* Mining pool integration.
* Real-time simulated hash rate generation.
* Basic earnings calculations.
* Simulated blockchain updates for a more realistic mining experience.
 # Features
Dynamic Wallet Entry:

Allows users to input their Bitcoin wallet address at runtime.
Hash Rate Simulation:

Generates simulated billions of hashes per second for demonstration purposes.
Earnings Calculation:

Tracks accepted shares and estimates earnings based on mining performance.
Withdrawal Simulation:

Automatically processes a simulated withdrawal when the earnings threshold is met.
Resource Efficiency:

Controlled CPU usage during mining to ensure system performance.
Requirements
A Linux-based system (or compatible Unix-like OS).
bash shell.
Package manager (apt or pkg).
Basic knowledge of shell scripting.
Installation and Usage
Clone or download the script:

bash
Copy code
git clone (https://github.com/sagarparajul107/btc_miner)
cd bitcoin-mining-script
Make the script executable:

bash
Copy code
chmod +x mine_btc.sh
Run the script:

bash
Copy code
./mine_btc.sh
Enter your Bitcoin wallet address when prompted.

Important Notes
This script is intended only for educational purposes.
Do not misuse it for malicious activities such as unauthorized cryptocurrency mining.
The hash rate and earnings are simulated and do not represent real mining profitability.
