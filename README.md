# Bitcoin Mining Project - Educational Purpose
* Author: Sagar Parajuli
Purpose: This project is designed for educational purposes to demonstrate the basics of cryptocurrency mining using a shell script. 
Please use this project responsibly and do not misuse it for malicious or unethical activities.
# Overview
This project showcases a simple shell script for mining Bitcoin using the CPU. It incorporates:

* Wallet address configuration.
* Mining pool integration.
* Real-time simulated hash rate generation.
* Basic earnings calculations.
* Simulated blockchain updates for a more realistic mining experience.
 # Features
Dynamic Wallet Entry:

Allows users to input their Bitcoin wallet address at runtime.
Hash Rate Simulation:

Generates simulated billions of hashes per second for demonstration purposes.
Earnings Calculation:

Tracks accepted shares and estimates earnings based on mining performance.
Withdrawal Simulation:

Automatically processes a simulated withdrawal when the earnings threshold is met.
Resource Efficiency:

Controlled CPU usage during mining to ensure system performance.
Requirements
A Linux-based system (or compatible Unix-like OS).
bash shell.
Package manager (apt or pkg).
Basic knowledge of shell scripting.
Installation and Usage
Clone or download the script:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/bitcoin-mining-script.git
cd bitcoin-mining-script
Make the script executable:

bash
Copy code
chmod +x mine_btc.sh
Run the script:

bash
Copy code
./mine_btc.sh
Enter your Bitcoin wallet address when prompted.

Important Notes
This script is intended only for educational purposes.
Do not misuse it for malicious activities such as unauthorized cryptocurrency mining.
The hash rate and earnings are simulated and do not represent real mining profitability.
Disclaimer
This project does not mine actual Bitcoin but serves as a conceptual demonstration. The use of this project is solely the responsibility of the user. Any misuse or violation of laws is strictly prohibited. The author is not liable for any consequences resulting from improper use of this project.
